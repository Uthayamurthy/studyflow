Your task is to determine if the following user query requires additional context from previously uploaded documents.

Consider the following factors:

    If the query is general or a follow-up to previous conversation, context may not be needed.
    If the query asks for specific information that is unlikely to be in the chat history, context should be retrieved.
    If unsure, prioritize accuracy and retrieve context only if essential.

Respond with only 'Yes' or 'No'â€”no explanations.
